## Running

- Clone the repo
- cd into this directory
- Build: `g++ main.cpp`
- Run: `a.exe order.txt warehouse.txt`

**a.exe can vary, it's the executable name that your build line creates.**

**order.txt and warehouse.txt are place holders. I have some files in the test directory you can use or make your own and plug them in.**
